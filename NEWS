2013-06-18: Neil & Chris picked up this project again.

2013-01-03: Neil & Chris began this project just before the Christmas holiday 
            season in 2012 as a way to refresh and rejuvenate in the midst of a
            major professional programming project (unrelated to this product).

            After two weeks of coding (with some well deserved vacation time
            for good measure) we decided to go open source and publish!

            We're giving GitHub a try in hopes of working with some interesting 
            contributors that, like us, enjoy learning to generate fractal 
            imagery and helping to improve this product along the way.

2025-02-01: Chris containerized the app w/ Docker and converted the project from
            make to cmake.
